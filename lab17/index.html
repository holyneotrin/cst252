    <h1>Lab 17: Object-Oriented Design</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Working with your partner, create a JavaScript constructor.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I had some issues with placing the jquery append, and I forgot to put jquery in my code entirely. So it took me a bit for everything to work.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are the results!</p>
      <h3>Hangman OOP</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>One player thinks of a word and the rest of the players guess the word one letter at a time.[Player]</li>
        <li>The chosen player writes a number of dashes equal to the word length [Player + Hangman]</li>
        <li>If the guessing player gets a letter correct, the writing player fills out the letter in the correct spots [Player + Hangman]</li>
        <li>If the letter is not in the word, the writing player draws a pieve of the hangman's gallows. [Player + Hangman]</li>
        <li>Once the hangman's gallows is fully completed, the game ends. [Hangman]</li>
        <li>The first player to guess the correct word, gets to choose the next word. [Hangman]</li>
      </ol>
