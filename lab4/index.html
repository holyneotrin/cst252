	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>Pseudocode an everyday task and a computer task. Then turn your pseudocode into comments.

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>I had some difficulty understanding how to go about the Javascript portion of the homework. After reading the instructions a couple times, I understood how to go about the assignment. I'm not sure about the pre and code tags though. I could not figure out what was being asked of me.</p>
