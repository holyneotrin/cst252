    <h1>Lab 13: Conditionals</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had some problems trying to get the functions to work all at once. First,
    the button would only display the image after clicking on it twice. After I fixed that,
    had some difficulty getting the results to display on top of the image. After referencing
    back to lab 7 and using what I learn, it all worked out in the end!</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Write your full name in the field below!</p>
