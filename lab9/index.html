    <h1>Lab 9: Javascript for the Web</h1>
    <p>Working with a partner, mess with experimenting with the DOM.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I wanted to create a break in between the buttons to better differentiate them. I searched online and attempted a few solutions, but my
      code would not take. So in the end, I created a DOM margin to create a small gap between the buttons.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Here are the results!</p>
    <div id=output>
      <p></p>
    </div>
